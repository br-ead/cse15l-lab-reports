Hello, I recently typed up my grade.sh, but I am starting to receive issues for almost no reason? It worked previously, I do not know why it is working now. I think it may be something to do with my JUnit test, as there are a ton of errors regarding it.

Hello, it appears that the JUnit test are never initialized. This may come as a result of the importing process. Are you utilizing bash or powershell? Did you switch from mac to windows and not adjust the : for macs or ; for windows?
